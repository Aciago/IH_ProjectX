# :video_game: Analysis of "Life Beyond" data (early alpha game development)

### :briefcase: Scenario:
Darewise is a young gamedev studio based in Paris, France. Their game "Life Beyond" recently entered alpha testing and lacks data analysis. CEO wants to have as much insights from what they have as possible. This will produce value for game designers and everyone involved.

Since Darewise owns all rights to their product, I had to sign various NDAs that prohibit public showing of their data and other internal materials. This was my final project done in Ironhack Paris bootcamp.

### :package: Dataset:
Our dataset consists of data generated by "Life Beyond" game engine, players and websites. It is processed by Microsoft Azure PlayFab, stored in GCP (Google Cloud Platform) within BigQuery. We used Python to connect to GCP BigQuery and access data.

### :bar_chart: Results and conclusions:
